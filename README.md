# label-tracker

Fork of <https://git.eno.space/label-tracker.git>.

Fetcher TODO:

1. Nightly detection of recently merged PRs.
2. Nightly detection of new/updated <interesting> branches.

where <interesting> means either a release branch or a channel, aka matches regex: "nixos-*"

Future: faster detection of above via webhook
